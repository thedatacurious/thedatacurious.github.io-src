### Wedding songs reimagined as cupcakes
For the 2019 XDS Data Storytelling Challenge, which had the theme of love, I visualized popular wedding songs in R and Inkscape based on their musical attributes. My entry received a commendation for creativity and design. Used Python and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore Spotify data.

### Tools of the trade
Inspected and preprocessed dataset from the 2019 Data Visualisation Community Survey results, which covers details like job roles and tool use, in Python. Used findings to design an [infographic](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/annual-survey-challenge/2019/10/22/challenge-title-aakh3) that helps people interested in data visualisation decide which technical tools to learn or get better at.

*Each cell below represents the percentage of practitioners who use a certain tool, based on (i) their role and (ii) whether they are able to choose their tools (colored icon for job role) or if the choice is made for them (grey icon)*

### Next Big Hit in Hip Hop
Built a linear regression model in Python to see if a hip hop artist's billboard status could
predict a track's popularity. Long story short: It doesn't. Used Beautiful Soup and Selenium for
web scraping.

### Gender-equity paradox
Used R to investigate and visualized the paradox where women in more gender-equal countries are less likely to be in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Recreated data viz in Tableau.
