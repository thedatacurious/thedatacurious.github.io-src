I'm a political analyst turned coder who enjoys digging into the data to uncover insights and
stories.

My time in international policy saw me working under tight deadlines with diverse nationalities on issues like shipping's effects on climate change. I then went into strategic planning, which further exposed me to high-level decision-making and opportunities to use research for a range of purposes, from advising senior management on key trends to responding to press queries. My experience also got me curious about using data science technique to add value to my research work. I'm currently in the Metis Data Science bootcamp in pursuit of this curiosity. As Chief Editor for She Loves Data, a nonprofit supporting women in tech, I help to grow our global online community.
