Summary: For a data storytelling challenge on the theme of love, I played around with the idea of visualizing something that we experience as sounds. I had a lot of fun with my entry and I'm happy to share that I received a commendation by the judges for creativty and design.

### Behind the scene

My inspiration came from the idea of 'data portraits', where you create visual designs based on a set of attributes, having seen Amy Cesal and Zander Furnas' [wedding project](https://medium.com/nightingale/https-medium-com-data-visualization-society-wedding-data-viz-36e7b9f4787f), Susie Wu's [film flowers](http://bl.ocks.org/sxywu/raw/d612c6c653fb8b4d7ff3d422be164a5d/).

* Wedding songs as the data topic - It began with a single question, "Why do I always seem to hear Ed Sheeran at the weddings I attend?" This got me curious about the profile of popular wedding songs.
* Cupcakes as the base - I wanted to use items commonly found at wedding and considered using wedding favours, banquet tables, etc. Cupcakes proved to hit the sweet spot as a canvas that could accommodate multiple layers of designs without being too complex.
* Mapping music attributes to cupcake decorations - icing colour, the number of icing loops, silver drag√©es, and chocolate accents. I stuck to four music attributes (decoration types) so that the viz wouldn't look too busy.

It took a few rounds of experimentations before I ended with the design I wanted. Many thanks to ![Joel Schneider](https://wjschne.github.io/spiro/index.html) for the spirographs library, which I used to create the icing effect.
